# seq_classification

Scripts for classifying eDNA reads into operational taxonomic units.

1. Create list of marine taxa using WoRMS dataset
2. Download COI sequences from GenBank
3. Download COI sequences from BOLD and find species for which the download has to be repeated due to errors in initial run.
4. Merge COI sequences from GenBank and BOLD to create one fasta file.
